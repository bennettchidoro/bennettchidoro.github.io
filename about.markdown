Hey! 

I’m Bennett. Most of my friends call be “B”, though. 

I’m currently building <a href="http://thepsychedelicnewsletter.com/">The Psychedelic Newsletter.</a>

Some people say it’s one of the most magical places on the internet. I just wanted an excuse to shroom out again. 

I’m a first-generation, self-proclaimed “Mushroom Entrepreneur.”

I'm still wrapping my head around the whole idea, so here's the definition according to my lady ChatGPT:

<blockquote class="ml0 pl3 bl bw2 b--primary i f4 lh-copy">
  “A mushroom entrepreneur is someone who builds a business or brand centered around mushrooms — often blending health, wellness, education, or underground culture — by creating innovative products, services, or experiences that reflect the power and potential of fungi.”
</blockquote>

And I coudn't agree more. 

Anyways, one more thing than I'm out. 

I've recently (for the better part of a year), been obsessed — and giving myself a world-class education in all things Internet Marketing. 

I'm pumped to test everything out in mushroom space.
